# Performance Optimization Guide

## Current Performance Baseline

### Multi-Stage Execution Analysis
**Total Execution Time**: 40.7 seconds average

| Stage | Duration | Operations | Bottleneck Type |
|-------|----------|------------|-----------------|
| Intent Classification | 3.4s (8.3%) | LLM routing decision | LLM Processing |
| Stage 1: Discovery | 14.4s (35.4%) | SQL generation + execution | SQL Performance |
| Stage 2: Analysis | 15.7s (38.5%) | SQL generation + execution | SQL Performance |
| Stage 3: Evaluation | 7.1s (17.4%) | Pure LLM analysis | LLM Processing |

### Key Performance Insights
- **SQL operations dominate**: 30.1s (74%) of total execution time
- **Database execution is fast**: ~0.2s actual query execution
- **SQL generation is slow**: 14+ seconds per LLM-generated query
- **LLM processing is reasonable**: 10.5s combined for all AI operations

## Optimization Strategy

### ðŸš€ High Impact Optimizations (Target: 50% reduction)

#### 1. SQL Generation Caching
**Current Issue**: Each stage regenerates SQL from scratch
**Solution**: Implement pattern-based SQL caching

```python
# Cache frequently used SQL patterns
SQL_PATTERN_CACHE = {
    "product_discovery": {
        "pattern": "SELECT pt.pt_part, pt.pt_desc1 FROM JPNPROdb_pt_mstr pt WHERE {search_conditions}",
        "variables": ["search_conditions"],
        "ttl": 3600  # 1 hour cache
    }
}
```

**Expected Impact**: 60-70% reduction in Stage 1 & 2 times (14.4s â†’ 5s, 15.7s â†’ 6s)

#### 2. Parallel Tool Execution
**Current Issue**: Sequential tool execution in each stage
**Solution**: Run independent operations in parallel

```python
# Parallel execution example
async def execute_stage_with_parallel():
    sql_task = asyncio.create_task(run_sql_query(enhanced_question))
    summary_task = asyncio.create_task(prepare_summary_context())
    
    sql_result = await sql_task
    summary_result = await summary_task.run_with_data(sql_result)
```

**Expected Impact**: 20-30% reduction in overall execution time

#### 3. Database Query Optimization
**Current Issue**: Complex JOIN operations without proper indexing
**Solution**: Add targeted indexes for common query patterns

```sql
-- Recommended indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IX_pt_mstr_search ON JPNPROdb_pt_mstr (pt_desc1, pt_desc2, pt_part);
CREATE INDEX IX_ps_mstr_lookup ON JPNPROdb_ps_mstr (ps_comp, ps_par, ps_domain);
CREATE INDEX IX_nqpr_pricing ON JPNPROdb_nqpr_mstr (nqpr_comp, nqpr_domain, nqpr_price);
```

**Expected Impact**: 30-40% reduction in SQL execution time

### ðŸŽ¯ Medium Impact Optimizations

#### 4. LLM Response Caching
**Current Issue**: Repeated LLM calls for similar queries
**Solution**: Implement semantic caching for LLM responses

```python
# Semantic similarity caching
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

class SemanticCache:
    def __init__(self, similarity_threshold=0.95):
        self.encoder = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
        self.cache = {}
        self.threshold = similarity_threshold
    
    def get_cached_response(self, question):
        question_embedding = self.encoder.encode([question])
        # Check similarity with cached questions
        # Return cached response if similarity > threshold
```

**Expected Impact**: 70-80% reduction for repeated question types

#### 5. Connection Pool Optimization
**Current Issue**: Database connection overhead per query
**Solution**: Implement persistent connection pooling

```python
# Enhanced connection pooling
from sqlalchemy.pool import QueuePool

engine = create_engine(
    connection_string,
    poolclass=QueuePool,
    pool_size=10,
    max_overflow=20,
    pool_pre_ping=True,
    pool_recycle=3600
)
```

**Expected Impact**: 5-10% reduction in database operation time

#### 6. Streaming Response Implementation
**Current Issue**: Users wait for complete analysis before seeing any results
**Solution**: Stream Stage 1 results immediately

```python
# Streaming response architecture
async def stream_multi_stage_response(question):
    yield {"stage": "classification", "result": classification}
    
    stage1_result = await execute_stage1()
    yield {"stage": "discovery", "result": stage1_result}
    
    stage2_result = await execute_stage2(stage1_result) 
    yield {"stage": "analysis", "result": stage2_result}
    
    stage3_result = await execute_stage3(stage1_result, stage2_result)
    yield {"stage": "evaluation", "result": stage3_result}
```

**Expected Impact**: Improved perceived performance, better UX

### ðŸ“Š Performance Monitoring Enhancements

#### 7. Advanced Performance Metrics
**Implementation**: Enhanced logging with stage-level performance tracking

```python
# Detailed performance tracking
class PerformanceTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stage_timings = {}
        self.sql_performance = {}
        self.llm_performance = {}
    
    def track_stage(self, stage_name):
        return StageTimer(stage_name, self)
    
    def log_comprehensive_metrics(self):
        # Log detailed breakdown for optimization analysis
```

#### 8. Performance Alerting
**Implementation**: Real-time alerts for performance degradation

```python
# Performance threshold monitoring
PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLDS = {
    "total_execution": 60000,  # 60 seconds
    "sql_generation": 10000,   # 10 seconds
    "database_execution": 5000, # 5 seconds
    "stage3_evaluation": 15000  # 15 seconds
}
```
